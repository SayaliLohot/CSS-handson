   <h3 class="questions">Q2.Show implementation of transformation</h3>

   <p>CSS transforms are a collection of functions that allow to shape elements in
particular ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Translate: moves the element along up to 3 axis (x, y and z)</li>
    <li>Rotate: moves the element around a central point</li>
    <li>Scale: resizes the element</li>
    <li>Skew: distorts the element</li>
</ul>

      <div class="p5que2"></div>

   <h3 class="questions">Q4.What are CSS combinators </h3>
   <p>Combinators combine the selectors to provide them a useful relationship and the
    position of content in the document. This comes in handy when you want to style
    certain elements all at once rather than styling elements individually. CSS
    combinator selectors are as follows.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Descendant Selector : The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.</li>
    
        <li>Child Selector : The child selector will only affect elements under a direct parent. A good way to remember this is that a child will only listen to its direct parents.
            </li>
        <li>Adjacent Sibling Selector : To use the adjacent sibling selector in your CSS
            stylesheet, you simply need the plus (+) sign. The adjacent sibling selector is used
            to select an element that is directly after another specific element.</li>
        <li>General Sibling Selectors :The general sibling selector follows through on all
            elements under the targeted HTML element selected. This means that if another
            element tag interrupts the direct adjacent flow, the style rules can still follow
            through</li>
    </ul>

   <!-- combine selctore just to provide relation between selectors<br>
   1 descending selector: <b>all child element </b>get select div p...p under div space is descending selectors div p is desceding but if we used div > p it select only direct child <br>
   2 child selctor: only direct child<br>
   3. adjacent sibling selector: direct after adjusting sibling h3+p means only p will get select.<br>
   4. general sibling selector: button~p all p tag will select after the end of button tag.(follow through all elemet under the targeted html elemet selected) -->

   <h3 class="questions">Q5.What are pseudo selectors in CSS</h3>
    <p>CSS pseudo-classes are used to add styles to selectors, but only when those selectors meet certain conditions. A pseudo class is expressed by adding a colon (:) after a selector in CSS, followed by a pseudo-class such as "hover" "focus", or "active", like this:</p>
